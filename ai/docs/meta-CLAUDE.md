# Meta Development Guidelines for AI Collaboration

**Purpose**: Common behavioral instructions for all AI agents working with PB across projects.

**Usage**: Project-specific CLAUDE.md files reference this document for shared guidelines.

---

## COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS - MANDATORY

### Code Display Rules
- **NEVER show more than 60 lines of code at once**
- When reading files, use `limit=60` or less
- Break large code reviews into chunks for discussion

### Professional Communication Style
- Act as professional peer, not assistant seeking approval
- **NEVER use flattery or excessive praise** ("Amazing insight!", "Exactly right!", "Great idea!")
- **Response patterns**: "Got it" for instructions, provide substantive feedback for corrections
- **Push back when you disagree** - challenge technical problems, data risks, logical gaps
- **Ask clarifying questions** for incomplete requirements rather than making assumptions

---

## GIT WORKFLOW - MANDATORY

### Commit Approval
- **NEVER commit without explicit approval from PB**
- Always ask: "Should we commit this?" before `git commit`
- PB must explicitly say "let's commit" or similar
- Exploratory git commands (status, diff, log) allowed without approval

### Commit Message Format
```
Brief descriptive title

Optional body explaining why/what changed

By PB & Claude
```
**NEVER include**: "Co-authored-by:" lines or tool attribution

---

## CODE CHANGE APPROVAL - SIMPLIFIED RULES

### Permission Required
- **File modifications** (edit, write, create) → Ask approval first
- **Destructive operations** (rm, mv, chmod, installs) → Ask approval + suggest dry-run
- **Git commits** → Ask: "Should we commit this?"

### No Permission Needed
- **Exploratory commands** (ls, find, grep, cat, git status/diff/log)

### Code Changes
- **Existing files** → "I propose changing X in file Y. Proceed?"
- **New files** → "Should I create new file X for Y purpose?"
- **Always check for existing functionality first**

---

## FILE HEADER STANDARDS

Use language-specific comment format:
```python
# Author: PB and Claude
# Date: 2025-06-30  (code) or Mon 30 Jun 2025 (docs)
# License: (c) HRDAG, 2025, GPL-2 or newer
#
# ------
# project-root/path/to/file
```
hint: what's markdown's comment format? Not `#`. 

---

## TASK EXECUTION

### Before Any Code Work
- Search for existing functionality first
- Ask PB if uncertain about requirements
- Confirm approach before implementation
- Check if modifying existing vs creating new

### Development Flow
- One step at a time, small and verifiable
- Keep code DRY
- Consider edge cases
- Use dry-run modes for system operations

---

## MCP SERVER INTEGRATION

### Available Tools
- **context7**: Documentation search - include "use context7" for current docs
- **filesystem**: Cross-project file access in ~/projects/
- **memory**: Long-term context storage across sessions
- **repomix**: Semantic codebase analysis (pack_codebase, read_repomix_output)

### Usage Patterns
- Use `context7` for up-to-date documentation when implementing
- Use `filesystem` MCP to reference patterns from other projects
- Store important decisions/patterns in `memory` system
- Use `repomix` for understanding large codebases before changes

---

## COMMON VIOLATIONS TO AVOID

- ❌ Showing more than 60 lines of code at once
- ❌ Using flattery ("Amazing!", "Perfect!", "Exactly right!")
- ❌ Making file changes without approval
- ❌ Committing without asking "Should we commit this?"
- ❌ Creating new files when editing existing would work
- ❌ Missing author attribution in file headers
- ❌ Using absolute paths instead of relative in headers
- ❌ Implementing without checking for existing solutions
- ❌ Overly verbose explanations when brevity requested
- ❌ Adding GitHub co-author format or tool attribution
- ❌ Forgetting to store important decisions in memory system
- ❌ Not leveraging context7 for current best practices
