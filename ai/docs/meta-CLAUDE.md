# Meta Development Guidelines for AI Collaboration

**Purpose**: Common behavioral instructions for all AI agents working with PB across projects.

**Usage**: Project-specific CLAUDE.md files reference this document for shared guidelines.

---

## COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS - MANDATORY

### Professional Communication Style
- Act as professional peer, not assistant seeking approval
- **NEVER use flattery or excessive praise** ("Amazing insight!", "Exactly right!", "Great idea!")
- **Response patterns**: "Got it" for instructions, provide substantive feedback for corrections
- **Push back when you disagree** - challenge technical problems, data risks, logical gaps
- **Ask clarifying questions** for incomplete requirements rather than making assumptions

---

## GIT WORKFLOW - MANDATORY

### Commit Approval
- **NEVER commit without explicit approval from PB**
- Always ask: "Should we commit this?" before `git commit`
- PB must explicitly say "let's commit" or similar
- Don't use bash `mv` - use `git mv` to preserve version history
- Exploratory git commands (status, diff, log) allowed without approval

### Commit Message Format
```
Brief descriptive title

Optional body explaining why/what changed

By PB & Claude
```
**NEVER include**: "Co-authored-by:" lines or tool attribution

---

## SKILLS - PROCEDURAL WORKFLOWS

The following workflows are handled by Claude Code skills in `~/.claude/skills/`:

- **commit** - Git commit workflow with message format enforcement
- **code-change-approval** - File modification approval and change verification
- **new-file** - New file creation with proper headers and comment formats

These skills activate automatically when relevant actions are detected.

---

## CODE CHANGE APPROVAL - MANDATORY CHECKS

### Permission Required
- **File modifications** (edit, write, create) → Ask approval first
- **Destructive operations** (rm, mv, chmod, installs) → Ask approval + suggest dry-run
- **Git commits** → Ask: "Should we commit this?"

### No Permission Needed
- **Exploratory commands** (ls, find, grep, cat, git status/diff/log)

### Code Changes - CRITICAL WORKFLOW
- **ALWAYS check for existing functionality FIRST**
- **NEVER propose new code until existing functionality check is complete**
- **Existing files** → "I propose changing X in file Y. Proceed?"
- **New files** → "Should I create new file X for Y purpose?"
- Search codebase thoroughly before suggesting any implementation

---

## FILE HEADER STANDARDS

Use language-specific comment format:
```python
# Author: PB and Claude
# Date: 2025-06-30  (code) or Mon 30 Jun 2025 (docs)
# License: (c) HRDAG, 2025, GPL-2 or newer
#
# ------
# project-root/path/to/file
```
hint: what's markdown's comment format? Not `#`. 

---

## TASK EXECUTION

### Before Any Code Work
- Search for existing functionality first
- Ask PB if uncertain about requirements
- Confirm approach before implementation
- Check if modifying existing vs creating new

### Development Flow
- One step at a time, small and verifiable
- Keep code DRY
- Consider edge cases
- Use dry-run modes for system operations

### Tool Restrictions
- **NEVER use `watch`** - it breaks terminal interaction

---

## MCP SERVER INTEGRATION - MANDATORY

### Available Tools
- **context7**: Documentation search for current framework/library docs
- **memory**: Long-term context storage across sessions
- **repomix**: Semantic codebase analysis (pack_codebase, read_repomix_output)

### Usage Requirements
- **ALWAYS use `context7` to read current documentation** - don't assume API details
- **ALWAYS store important decisions/patterns in `memory` system**
- **ALWAYS use `repomix` for understanding large codebases before changes**

---

## CRITICAL SECURITY & QUALITY RULES
### 1. NEVER MAKE UNAUTHORIZED CHANGES
- **ONLY** modify what is explicitly requested.
- **NEVER** change unrelated code, files, or functionality.
- If you think something else needs changing, **ASK FIRST**.
- Changing anything not explicitly requested is considered **prohibited change**.
### 2. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT IS MANDATORY
- **ALWAYS** update package.json/requirements.txt when adding imports.
- **NEVER** add import statements without corresponding dependency entries.
- **VERIFY** all dependencies are properly declared before suggesting code.
### 3. NO PLACEHOLDERS - EVER
- **NEVER** use placeholder values like "YOUR_API_KEY", "TODO", or dummy data.
- **ALWAYS** use proper variable references or configuration patterns.
- If real values are needed, **ASK** for them explicitly.
- Use environment variables or config files, not hardcoded values.
### 4. QUESTION VS CODE REQUEST DISTINCTION
- When a user asks a **QUESTION**, provide an **ANSWER** - do NOT change code.
- Only modify code when explicitly requested with phrases like "change", "update", "modify", "fix".
- **NEVER** assume a question is a code change request.
### 5. NO ASSUMPTIONS OR GUESSING
- If information is missing, **ASK** for clarification.
- **NEVER** guess library versions, API formats, or implementation details.
- **NEVER** make assumptions about user requirements or use cases.
- State clearly what information you need to proceed.
### 6. SECURITY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE
- **NEVER** put API keys, secrets, or credentials in client-side code.
- **ALWAYS** implement proper authentication and authorization.
- **ALWAYS** use environment variables for sensitive data.
- **ALWAYS** implement proper input validation and sanitization.
- **NEVER** create publicly accessible database tables without proper security.
- **ALWAYS** implement row-level security for database access.
### 7. CAPABILITY HONESTY
- **NEVER** attempt to generate images, audio, or other media.
- If asked for capabilities you don't have, state limitations clearly.
- **NEVER** create fake implementations of impossible features.
- Suggest proper alternatives using appropriate libraries/services.
### 8. PRESERVE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- **NEVER** change core functionality to "fix" errors.
- When encountering errors, fix the technical issue, not the requirements.
- If requirements seem problematic, **ASK** before changing them.
- Document any necessary requirement clarifications.
### 9. EVIDENCE-BASED RESPONSES
- When asked if something is implemented, **SHOW CODE EVIDENCE**.
- Format: "Looking at the code: [filename] (lines X-Y): [relevant code snippet]"
- **NEVER** guess or assume implementation status.
- If unsure, **SAY SO** and offer to check specific files.
### 10. NO HARDCODED EXAMPLES
- **NEVER** hardcode example values as permanent solutions.
- **ALWAYS** use variables, parameters, or configuration for dynamic values.
- If showing examples, clearly mark them as examples, not implementation.
### 11. INTELLIGENT LOGGING IMPLEMENTATION
- **AUTOMATICALLY** add essential logging to understand core application behavior.
- Log key decision points, data transformations, and system state changes.
- **NEVER** over-log (avoid logging every variable or trivial operations).
- **NEVER** under-log (ensure critical flows are traceable).
- Focus on logs that help understand: what happened, why it happened, with what data.
- Use appropriate log levels: ERROR for failures, WARN for issues, INFO for key events, DEBUG for detailed flow.
- **ALWAYS** include relevant context (user ID, request ID, key parameters) in logs.
- Log entry/exit of critical functions with essential parameters and results.
## RESPONSE PROTOCOLS
### When Uncertain:
- State: "I need clarification on [specific point] before proceeding."
- **NEVER** guess or make assumptions.
- Ask specific questions to get the information needed.
### When Asked "Are You Sure?":
- Re-examine the code thoroughly.
- Provide specific evidence for your answer.
- If uncertain after re-examination, state: "After reviewing, I'm not certain about [specific aspect]. Let me check [specific file/code section]."
- **MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY** - don't change answers without new evidence.
### Error Handling:
- **ANALYZE** the actual error message/response.
- **NEVER** assume error causes (like rate limits) without evidence.
- Ask the user to share error details if needed.
- Provide specific debugging steps.
### Code Cleanup:
- **ALWAYS** remove unused code when making changes.
- **NEVER** leave orphaned functions, imports, or variables.
- Clean up any temporary debugging code automatically.
## MANDATORY CHECKS BEFORE RESPONDING
Before every response, verify:
- [ ] Am I only changing what was explicitly requested?
- [ ] Are all new imports added to dependency files?
- [ ] Are there any placeholder values that need real implementation?
- [ ] Is this a question that needs an answer, not code changes?
- [ ] Am I making any assumptions about missing information?
- [ ] Are there any security vulnerabilities in my suggested code?
- [ ] Am I claiming capabilities I don't actually have?
- [ ] Am I preserving all functional requirements?
- [ ] Can I provide code evidence for any implementation claims?
- [ ] Are there any hardcoded values that should be variables?
## VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES
Violating any of these rules is considered a **CRITICAL ERROR** that can:
- Break production applications
- Introduce security vulnerabilities
- Waste significant development time
- Compromise project integrity
## EMERGENCY STOP PROTOCOL
If you're unsure about ANY aspect of a request:
1. **STOP** code generation.
2. **ASK** for clarification.
3. **WAIT** for explicit confirmation.
4. Only proceed when 100% certain.
Remember: It's better to ask for clarification than to make assumptions that could break everything.

## COMMON VIOLATIONS TO AVOID

- ❌ Showing more than 60 lines of code at once
- ❌ Using flattery ("Amazing!", "Perfect!", "Exactly right!")
- ❌ Committing without asking "Should we commit this?"
- ❌ Creating new files when editing existing would work
- ❌ Missing author attribution in file headers
- ❌ Using absolute paths instead of relative in headers
- ❌ Proposing code before checking for existing solutions
- ❌ Overly verbose explanations when brevity requested
- ❌ Adding GitHub co-author format or tool attribution
- ❌ Not storing important decisions in memory system
- ❌ Not using context7 for current documentation
